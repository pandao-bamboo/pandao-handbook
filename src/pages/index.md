# PanDAO Handbook

Welcome to the PanDAO Handbook. Everything you need to take part can be found here by following the links to the left. If you need to reach the DAO directly you can do so by joining our Discord or emailing support@pandao.org

# Mission Statement

Our mission is provide ethical insurance for assets. For now this is digital assets, but we invision a future where we can insure anything. We have no singular owner. Anyone who provides value to the DAO will be rewarded with ownership. We embrace decentralization and opensource in everything we do.

The mission of the network is to operate in an honest, open, and fair way. We believe that DAO's are the future of work because they allow you to join a community of other people and all work towards a common goal. All members are owners and share in the benefits regardless of their economic status in life. We also all share in the failures that come with that.

We work hard to provide a open, honest, and fair service for all participants in which we all benefit from better products, better customer service, and a better working environment. Because when someone is given true ownership, they will almost always put their best foot forward.
